   <p>The aim is to highlight small RNAs that change their expression
   profile according to some parameters. For instance, if you have 5 samples
   that are from 5 different ages, you can determine if some of the new small RNAs
   are correlated to ages doing this analysis. See following work: somel et al,
   <b>MicroRNA,mRNA, and protein expression link development and aging in human and macaque brain</b>.</p>
