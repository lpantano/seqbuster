**Please, be aware that the user friendly interface is desecrated. SeqBuster only keeps updated `miraligner` as an independent file.**


Read how to annotate miRNAs/isomiRs from fastq files in [our documentation page](https://seqcluster.readthedocs.io/mirna_annotation.html).

Some comparison between many tools [here](https://github.com/lpantano/mypubs/blob/master/mirna/mirannotation/stats.md).

SeqBuster is a bioinformatic tool for the processing and analysis of small RNAs datasets, reveals ubiquitous miRNA modifications in human embryonic cells. Pantano L, Estivill X, Mart√≠ E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Mar;38(5):e34. Epub 2009 Dec 11.

Other tools related to small RNA analysis.

*  R package [isomiRs](http://github.com/lpantano/isomiRs) to visualize isomiRs and miRNA abundances in a group of samples (**new**)
* [seqcluster](https://seqcluster.readthedocs.io) analyzes the rest of small RNAs and annotate to multiple databases in bed format (**new**)
